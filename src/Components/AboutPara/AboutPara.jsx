                    <h2>Abhijit Devghare</h2>
                    I have a bigger dreams. And I wanted one thing in my life is , I wish I should not stop learning things . First I want to be the good listener. If I talk about my carrer I want to a software developer who can try to solve any problem related to the software not just the solution in knowledge but to find new solution to the problems. I try to solve problems by own that makes me approachable to any problems. I wish i will become the one of the best person in my field. I believe in Lord Shri Krishna and I think whatever will be I will accept it move on. Lord Krishna keeps me motivated me.. <br />
                    That's all about me.
                </p>
